# Game development for PlayStation®4 and PlayStation®5 consoles 
Due to licensing restrictions, access to Defold versions with support for development on PS4 and PS5 is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with PS4 and PS5 game development support you need to be registered as a licensed PS4 and PS5 game developer respectively.

## Registering as developer for PS4 and PS5 game development
You can register as a game developer for PS4™ and PS5™ game development from the [PlayStation™ Partners page](https://register.playstation.net/partnership)

When you have been approved by Sony you will get access to the Playstation 5 DevNet and/or Playstation 4 DevNet. Navigate to Development > Tools & Middleware > Tools & Middleware directory > Defold. Click the ‘Confirm Status’ button.

## PS4™ and PS5™ access in Defold 
Once we have received confirmation of your status as a licensed developer for PS4™ and PS5™ we will provide you with access to the following:

* Source code access to the PS4™ and PS5™ extension with console specific API integrations.
* Source code access to the PS4™ and PS5™ enabled version of the Defold game engine will only be provided to PS5™ licensed game developers. Note that the source code access is not required to build games, but we provide access in case you wish to make source contributions to the engine core.
* [Command line tool](/manuals/bob) with support for bundling to the PS4™ and PS5™ platforms. Bundling from the Defold editor is not supported.
* Forum where you are able to get PS4™ and PS5™ specific support.
