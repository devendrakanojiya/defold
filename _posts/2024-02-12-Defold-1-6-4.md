## Engine
__NEW__: ([#8364](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8364)) __Updated to Xcode 15.1, iOS 17.2 and macOS 14.2__ 


__NEW__: ([#8353](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8353)) __Added options to control how json data is encoded and decoded__ 
It is now possible to configure the behaviour when encoding and decoding JSON data.

When encoding to JSON it is possible to control wether an empty Lua table should encode as a JSON object or array. The default behaviour when encoding an empty Lua table is to encode to a JSON object.

When decoding from JSON it is now possible to control wether a JSON null value should decode to `json-null` or `nil`. The default behaviour when decoding a JSON null value is to decode to nil.

```lua
local t = {}
json.encode(t, { encode_empty_table_as_object = true }) -- {}
json.encode(t, { encode_empty_table_as_object = false }) -- []
json.encode(t) -- {}


local s = "[ 1, 2, null, 3 ]"
json.decode(s, { decode_null_as_userdata = true}) -- { 1, 2, json.null, 4 }
json.decode(s, { decode_null_as_userdata = false}) -- { 1, 2, nil, 4 }
json.decode(s) -- { 1, 2, nil, 4 }
```

__NEW__: ([#8352](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8352)) __Generate a node id when cloning a gui node__ 
Cloned gui nodes are now automatically assigned a node id instead of an empty hash.

__NEW__: ([#8336](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8336)) __Added engine loader fallback when WebAssembly streaming fails__ 
The engine loader will now use XMLHttpRequest as a fallback when WebAssembly compilation and instantiation from a streamed source fails.

__NEW__: ([#8255](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8255)) __Custom vertex format support for Models__ 
We have added initial support for custom vertex formats for models.

__NEW__: ([#8296](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8296)) __Remove glfw from the engine builds__ 
GLFW is no longer being built as part of our main engine build. Instead, the current GLFW version (modified 2.7) is now begin built and distributed as an external package. We have also removed GLFW from our SDK, which means that some extensions might potentially break. This is considered a bugfix instead of a breaking change, since the headers should never have been part of the SDK from the first place.

This is the second part of our ongoing task (#7970) of migrating the current GLFW version to the latest stable official release, as well as separating all non-desktop platforms our of the GLFW infrastructure.

__NEW__: ([#8300](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8300)) __Dynamic resizing of collision shapes__ 
Added script functions to get and set collision shape sizes in runtime. The new functions are:

``` lua
physics.get_shape(url, shape_name)
physics.set_shape(url, shape_name, table)
```

For example, to update the box shape `my_box` for a collision object located at `/go#collisionobject`:

<img width="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/defold/defold/assets/169640/6a28d01b-03c7-40a7-8cd7-2090c387a72b">

``` lua
local box = physics.get_shape("/go#collisionobject", "my_box")
box.dimensions = box.dimensions + vmath.vector3(5,10,15)
physics.set_shape("/go#collisionobject", "my_box", box)
```

__NEW__: ([#8330](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8330)) __Load images in runtime as buffers__ 
The `image` script module now has a new function to return a buffer object. The new function is called `image.load_buffer` and can be used to dynamically create texture resources in runtime:

```lua
local img = image.load_buffer(compressed_data)
-- img.buffer now contains an actual buffer object that can be passed into resource.create_texture
local tparams = {
  width  = img.width,
  height = img.height,
  type   = resource.TEXTURE_TYPE_2D,
  format = resource.TEXTURE_FORMAT_RGBA
}
local my_texture_id = resource.create_texture("/my_custom_texture.texturec", tparams, img.buffer)
```

__NEW__: ([#8419](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8419)) __Add new default filtering keyword for material samplers (Engine support)__ 
This PR adds new filtering keyword for material samplers called:

``` lua
FILTER_MODE_MIN_DEFAULT
FILTER_MODE_MAG_DEFAULT
```

When using these settings on a sampler in the material, the engine will pick the global min and mag settings that is specified in the `game.project -> graphics` setting. This can be useful for having a global base filtering method, while still being able to specialise settings per sampler if needed.

__NEW__: ([#8421](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8421)) __Remove material count limit for models__ 
We have removed the limit for how many materials a model component can reference.

__NEW__: ([#8428](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8428)) __Added options in `sound.stop(url, [options])` where it's possible to specify what exactly voice should be stopped__ 
Now it's possible to stop one particular voice of the sound component:
```lua
     sound.stop("#sound")
     local id = sound.play("#sound")
     sound.stop("#sound", {play_id = id}) -- stop only one voice
```

__NEW__: ([#8416](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8416)) __New API functions: sys.load_buffer and sys.load_buffer_async__ 
Two new script functions has been added:

```lua
function async_callback(self, request_id, status, buf)
    -- do something with data here
end

local buf = sys.load_buffer(path)
local request_id = sys.load_buffer_async(path, callback)
```

These functions can be used to read data into a buffer object from either via the resource system, or direct file locations if the resource could not be found on any of the mounted resource locations. Meaning, the path supplied is not necessary a custom resource location, it can be any file on disk.

__NEW__: ([#8429](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8429)) __Added `physics.set_listener(fn)` to set a function as the physics world listener__ 
Now, it is possible to set a function that will receive all physics interaction events in one place. If a function is set, physics messages will no longer be sent.

```lua
physics.set_listener(function(self, event, data)
  if event == hash("contact_point_event") then
    pprint(data)
    -- {
    --  applied_impulse = 310.00769042969,
    --  distance = 0.0714111328125,
    --  a = {
    --    position = vmath.vector3(446, 371, 0),
    --    relative_velocity = vmath.vector3(1.1722083854693e-06, -20.667181015015, -0),
    --    mass = 0,
    --    group = hash: [default],
    --    id = hash: [/flat],
    --    normal = vmath.vector3(-0, -1, -0)
    --  },
    --  b = {
    --    position = vmath.vector3(185, 657.92858886719, 0),
    --    relative_velocity = vmath.vector3(-1.1722083854693e-06, 20.667181015015, 0),
    --    mass = 10,
    --    group = hash: [default],
    --    id = hash: [/go2],
    --    normal = vmath.vector3(0, 1, 0)
    --  }
    -- }
  elseif event == hash("collision_event") then
    pprint(data)
    -- {
    --  a = {
    --      group = hash: [default],
    --      position = vmath.vector3(183, 666, 0),
    --      id = hash: [/go1]
    --    },
    --  b = {
    --      group = hash: [default],
    --      position = vmath.vector3(185, 704.05865478516, 0),
    --      id = hash: [/go2]
    --    }
    -- }
  elseif event ==  hash("trigger_event") then
    pprint(data)
    -- {
    --  enter = true,
    --  b = {
    --    group = hash: [default],
    --    id = hash: [/go2]
    --  },
    --  a = {
    --    group = hash: [default],
    --    id = hash: [/go1]
    --  }
    -- },
  elseif event ==  hash("ray_cast_response") then
    pprint(data)
    --{
    --  group = hash: [default],
    --  request_id = 0,
    --  position = vmath.vector3(249.92222595215, 249.92222595215, 0),
    --  fraction = 0.68759721517563,
    --  normal = vmath.vector3(0, 1, 0),
    --  id = hash: [/go]
    -- }
  elseif event ==  hash("ray_cast_missed") then
    pprint(data)
    -- {
    --  request_id = 0
    --},
  end
end)
```

__NEW__: ([#8456](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8456)) __New function `physics.update_mass(url, mass)`__ 
Added new function `physics.update_mass(url, mass)` which updates the mass of a dynamic 2D collision object in the physics world.

The function recalculates the density of each shape based on the total area of all shapes and the specified mass, then updates the mass of the body accordingly.


__NEW__: ([#8258](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8449)) __Added sprite multitexture support__
With the latest version, we now have support for multiple atlases in the sprite component.

To use it, you need a material and shader that has multiple samplers available.
The sprite will then display property fields where you can select an atlas for each sampler.

The animations shown are selected from the first sampler's atlas.
The sprite will use this animation's fps setting and frame names.

You will also need to match animations between atlases. If the default animation is "jump", then it will automatically choose the "jump" animation from the other atlases as well.
It is also required that frames within the animations matches.
In a scenario where `A.atlas` has animation `jump`:

    jump
        frame1.png
        frame2.png

Then `B.atlas` needs this animation as well:

    jump
        frame_normal_1.png
        frame_normal_1.png

In this case, the frame names _don't_ match, and you'll need to use the  `rename_patterns` field to alter the frame names.
It is a comma separated list of patterns:

    rename_patterns: _normal_=

In this example, it replaces the string "_normal_" with the string "", resulting in the final animation/frame names for `B.atlas`:

    jump
        frame1.png
        frame1.png


The documentation has been updated: https://defold.com/manuals/sprite/#multi-textured-sprites

__NEW__: ([#8439](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8439)) __Add `physics.JOINT_TYPE_WHEEL` for 2d physics__ 
Added `physics.JOINT_TYPE_WHEEL` for 2d physics

__FIX__: ([#8310](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8310)) __Update node transform if adjust mode changed using `gui.set_adjust_mode()`__ 
Fix bug when adjust mode applied to a node only after window resize.

__FIX__: ([#8338](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8338)) __Fix for outputting the correct skinned tangents__ 
Due to a typo, the skinned tangents weren't calculated correctly.

__FIX__: ([#8344](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8344)) __Buffered render buffers support__ 
Fixed an issue for certain graphics adapter where vertex and index buffers are overwritten during the same frame.

__FIX__: ([#8357](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8357)) __Add missing functions to null physics libraries__ 


__FIX__: ([#8358](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8358)) __Set data correctly when recreating dynamic texture in gui__ 
Bugfix for when recreating a deleted texture within the same frame in GUI:

``` lua
gui.new_texture(tex_id, img.width, img.height, img.type, img.buffer)
gui.delete_texture(tex_id)
gui.new_texture(tex_id, img.width, img.height, img.type, img.buffer)
gui.set_texture(node, tex_id)
```

__FIX__: ([#8293](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8293)) __Compute shader support, part deux__ 
This is the second part of the compute shader support, this PR includes engine resources for the compute program and shaders needed to build the compute program. At this point we cannot still reference the compute programs anywhere in the engine (which is the next step - to formalize a user-facing API around this work).

__FIX__: ([#8367](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8367)) __Fix ogg-validate invocation for sounds from mounted extensions__ 
Copy ogg resource to temp file to deal with resources from mount points (e.g. extensions). 
Ogg validation runs on temp ogg file now.
Temp files created into Bob root folder which removed at the end of the build.

__FIX__: ([#8369](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8369)) __Add hot reload functionality for label component.__ 
Add hot reload functionality for label component.
Reread properties from reloaded label resource and mark component to be rehashed.

__FIX__: ([#8450](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8450)) __If the `hash` string is unknown, show its value instead.__ 
Instead of showing just `<unknown>` when the corresponding string value is unknown, print its numeric value. For example:
>`<unknown:2256903789829718645>`

__FIX__: ([#8452](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8452)) __Remove redunant malloc in font_map__ 


__FIX__: ([#8461](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8461)) __Fixed how mass is calculated for physics collision objects with more than one shape.__ 
Fixed a bug where the mass specified in the Collision Object component was applied to each shape, resulting in the object's total mass becoming `Collision Object mass` x `Shapes count`.

With this fix, the mass will remain as specified in the Collision Object, and the density will be recalculated depending on it to be equal for each shape.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#8318](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8318)) __Select the default build server based on channel__ 
If the "Build Server" preference was never modified or is set to an empty string, the editor will pick either https://build-stage.defold.com or https://build.defold.com depending on the editor channel.

__NEW__: ([#8375](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8375)) __Slightly improve editor memory usage for large projects__ 
Slightly improve editor memory usage in projects with a large number of node endpoints. This typically corresponds to the number of files in the project, but varies significantly by file type.

Improves #8261

__NEW__: ([#8434](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8434)) __Add `editor.create_directory()` and code completion to editor scripts__ 
This changeset adds a new function to editor scripts that allows the user to create a new directory. The function expects a resource path, i.e. a `/`-prefixed path from the root of the project, for example:
```lua
editor.create_directory("/assets/generated")
local file = io.open("assets/generated/build.json")
file:write(...)
file:flush()
file:close()
```

Additionally, the editor now provides code completions for functions in the `editor` module.

__FIX__: ([#8418](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8418)) __Don't request LSP completions for dependencies__
