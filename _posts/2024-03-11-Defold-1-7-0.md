# Defold 1.7.0


## Release notes

As the version number suggests, in this version we have introduced some breaking changes.
The more important changes are related to texture mip map options, and also the removal of the `system_font` from the builtins package.
Please read those sections extra carefully.

There is also some "code cleanup" that may strictly be considered a breaking change. It relates to us removing old extension stubs.
It shouldn't affect anyone, as these extensions have been published to github and been in use for many years.

## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#8528](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8528)) __More options for min filter in `game.project`->`Graphics`->`Default Texture Min Filter`__ 
Now, the field `Default Texture Min Filter` in `game.project` -> `Graphics` has the same options as materials do.
This is a breaking change for projects that use mipmaps on their textures and the OpenGL graphics backend.

Old behavior was:
- Options `linear` and `nearest` as `Default Texture Min Filter` meant `TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST` and `TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST` respectively.
- If a texture without mipmaps was used with a material where `Min Filter` was specified with mipmaps, it used the `Mag Filter` option instead.

Current behavior:
- Options `linear` and `nearest` as `Default Texture Min Filter` mean `TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR` and `TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST` respectively.
- If a texture without mipmaps is used with a material where `Min Filter` is specified with mipmaps, it simply ignores the mipmaps part of the filter. For example, for `TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST`, it will be `TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR`, etc.

__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#8548](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8548)) __Removed deprecated extensions from the code__ 
In this release we've removed old extension stubs for `facebook`, `iap`, `iac`, `push` and `webview`.
This shouldn't affect any users, but is only part of an internal code cleanup task.
The actual extensions are found in the github repositories (e.g. https://github.com/defold/extension-iap)

__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#8559](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8559)) __Removed `system_font.font` from `builtins`__ 
This breaking change was implemented to clarify the usage of predefined fonts in `builtins`. The old `system_font.font` has been completely removed from the `builtins`, and two new fonts have been introduced:
1. `builtins/fonts/default.font`, which uses the default df material and can serve as a font for the development process.
2. `builtins/fonts/debug/always_on_top.font`, which utilizes a special material `builtins/fonts/debug/always_on_top_font.material` with the `debug_text` tag. This font is intended to be drawn on top of other elements and is used for debugging purposes (such as the profiler and the `draw_debug_text` message) as replacement of old `system_font.font`. Additionally, changes are required in `default.render_script`, where the old `text` predicate has been replaced with the `debug_text` predicate for clarity.

__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#8529](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8529)) __Turn mipmaps off in the `default.texture_profiles` file in `builtins`__ 
This is a breaking change for projects that use `default.texture_profiles` from the `builtins` folder.
If you need mipmaps for your textures, ensure you use a custom `default.texture_profiles` where this option is enabled.

__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#8553](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8553)) __Removed old deprecated messages__ 
The following messages were removed:
1. `msg.post(url, "request_transform")` and `"transform_response"` -- requests the transform from an instance
2. `msg.post(url, "set_tile", ...)` -- use `tilemap.set_tile()` instead

__NEW__: ([#8424](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8424)) __Render target as a resource__ 
A new resource type has been added that creates render targets that can be used as a regular texture in the engine.
<img width="649" alt="image" src="https://github.com/defold/defold/assets/169640/29e1eb0b-35d6-4a75-b66f-de7a479f2f4b">

The .render file has also been refactored to support this new render resource type. You can now add .render_target files into the render prototype resource. In the render_script, you can use these render targets in the same way as before, except that you can now pass in the render resource name when binding the render target:

<img width="641" alt="image" src="https://github.com/defold/defold/assets/169640/e1c6b929-af9f-4bf2-b196-1ec799380734">

```lua
-- in a render script:
render.set_render_target("my_rt")
```

A new function has also been added to .script files to get all the metadata about a render target resource:
`resource.get_render_target_info(path)`

__NEW__: ([#8322](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8322)) __Increased length of debug prints for urls to 256 per part and 512 in total__ 


__NEW__: ([#8513](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8513)) __Add missed `gui.BLEND_SCREEN` constant into `gui` module__ 
Added gui.BLEND_SCREEN, which was missing in the documentation as well as in the gui module.

__NEW__: ([#8525](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8525)) __Add camera focus message's wrappers.__ 
Now it possible to activate/deactivate camera component via `camera.acquire_focus`/ `camera.release_focus`.
```
camera.acquire_focus("/observer#main_camera")
```
```
camera.release_focus("/observer#main_camera")
```

__NEW__: ([#8562](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8562)) __Set custom vertex data API (Sprites)__ 
Added support for setting and getting vertex attributes for sprites via the `go.set`, `go.get` and `go.animate` functions. Similar to shader constants, the attributes has to be specified in the material:

<img width="638" alt="image" src="https://github.com/defold/defold/assets/169640/e8f82ab4-011e-4315-9719-794b64212f1e">

To modify the my_color attribute:

```lua
local my_color = go.get("#sprite", "my_color")
my_color.x = my_color.x + 0.5
go.set("#sprite", "my_color", my_color)
```

Or alternatively, you can use `go.animate`:

```lua
go.animate("#sprite", "my_color", go.PLAYBACK_LOOP_FORWARD, vmath.vector4(1, 0, 0, 1), go.EASING_INBACK, i))
```

__NEW__: ([#8577](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8577)) __Add support for enabling a render target resource in render.enable_texture__ 
Render script can now enable render targets specified in the `Render Resource` table in a `.render` file:

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/defold/defold/assets/169640/322cdf5e-f227-486e-831b-aa508e7dad85">

This can now be done by calling `render.enable_texture`:

```lua
-- draw something to a render target:
render.set_render_target("rt_res")
-- do drawing here and unbind RT
render.set_render_target(render.RENDER_TARGET_DEFAULT)

-- set the RT buffer 0 to a sampler and draw something using it
render.enable_texture("my_sampler", "rt_res", render. BUFFER_COLOR0_BIT) 
render.draw(self.my_predicate)
```

__NEW__: ([#8599](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8599)) __Flip image flag for image.load__ 
image.load and image.load_buffer can now flip images vertically when loading:

```
image.load_buffer(path, {  flip_vertically = true })
image.load(path, {  flip_vertically = true })
```

Note that the second argument will now accept an option table, with these arguments:

```
premultiply_alpha - True if alpha should be premultiplied into the color components. Defaults to `false`.
flip_vertically - True if the image contents should be flipped vertically. Defaults to `false`.
```

__NEW__: ([#8521](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8521)) __Add world to local coordinate system conversion API__
Add new APIs to convert world position and world transform to game object's coordinate space.
How to use:
 ```
    local test_pos = go.get_world_position("/test")
    local child_pos = go.get_world_position("/child")
    local new_position = go.world_to_local_position(test_pos, "/child")
 ```
 ```
    local test_transform = go.get_world_transform("/test")
    local child_transform = go.get_world_transform("/child")
    local result_transform = go.world_to_local_transform(test_transform, "/child")
 ``` 

__FIX__: ([#8371](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8371)) __Fix http request timeout usage in HTML5 build__ 
* Fix timeout option usage in http module for HTML5 implementation. 
* Update `http` module documentation.
* Wrap `HttpRequestAsync` arguments with struct.
* Fix possible memory leak.

__FIX__: ([#8477](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8477)) __Fix issue when profiler show wrong count of `GUI.ActiveNodes`__ 
Fixed an issue where nodes that aren't directly disabled, but are disabled because one of their parents is disabled in the tree, were incorrectly counted in `GUI.ActiveNodes` by the profiler.

__FIX__: ([#8486](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8486)) __Fixed an issue where the game wouldn't start if the iframe didn't allow gamepad usage (HTML5).__ 
Fixed the issue where the game doesn't start if access to gamepads is disallowed by the permissions policy.

__FIX__: ([#8484](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8484)) __Fix multi-buffered render buffers on non-opengl graphics adapters__ 
We have fixed an issue with models when using a multi-buffered render setup. This should have no effect on OpenGL-based rendering, but is important for console and vulkan adapters.

__FIX__: ([#8496](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8496)) __Fixed an issue where attempting to use IndexedDB when it is prohibited prevents game loading in HTML5.__ 
Fixed an issue where, in some rare cases, if IndexedDB usage is restricted, users may encounter the "Assertion failed: IDBFS used, but IndexedDB not supported" error.

__FIX__: ([#8493](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8493)) __Fix for crash caused by ray casting followed by deletion of the object__ 
Fixed a crash that occurs if `physics.raycast_async()` is called in the `on_message()` function and then the object is deleted immediately.

__FIX__: ([#8305](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/8305)) __add "Support texture handles in render.enable_texture" mention to API documentation__ 
For now there is no mention to support handles except a [rendertarget handle](https://defold.com/ref/stable/render/#render.enable_texture:unit-render_target-[buffer_type]):

But since [1.4.6](https://forum.defold.com/t/defold-1-4-6-has-been-released/73325) we have support texture handles:
```
-- in a regular gameobject script:
local my_texture_info = resource.get_texture_info("/my_atlas.a.texturesetc")
msg.post("@render:", "set_my_texture", { handle = my_texture_info.handle })

-- in a render script:
function update(self, dt)
    render.enable_texture(0, self.my_texture)
end

function on_message(self, message_id, message)
    if message_id == hash("set_my_texture") then
        self.my_texture = message.handle
    end
end

```

__FIX__: ([#8544](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8544)) __Send `sound_done` or `sound_stopped` messages only if the sound is played using `msg.post` with the `play_id` parameter.__ 
The sound component will send `sound_done` and `sound_stopped` messages only if `msg.post()` is used with the `play_id` parameter, as in `msg.post("#sound", "play_sound", {play_id = 1})`.

__FIX__: ([#8551](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8551)) __Fixed an issue where `bob.jar` did not delete some temporary folders after the bundling process was completed.__ 
Fixed an issue where, in some cases, `bob.jar` did not delete temporary folders. This could quickly fill up the disk on a CI machine.

__FIX__: ([#8552](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8552)) __Support sampler names in render.enable_texture__ 
Added support for enabling and disabling a sampler by a string or hash in a render script:

```lua
render.enable_texture(unit|name|hash, texture)
render.disable_texture(unit|name|hash, texture)
```

Previously a texture could only be bound to the renderer by texture units, which could cause issues when certain graphics adapters optimizes away unbound textures. With this new functionality, you can bind the same textures to multiple sampler names, which will be bound to the matching sampler name by the renderer when draw calls are issued:

```lua
render.enable_texture("my_global_texture", self.tex0)
render.enable_texture("some_other_sampler", self.tex0)
render.enable_texture("a_third_sampler", self.tex0)
```

It's however recommended that you use the same sampler name for all samplers in this case, this example just illustrates that it is possible to do so!

__FIX__: ([#8582](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8582)) __Crash fixes for the GDC tool__ 
Fixed an issue where the GDC tool would crash immediately after starting. This is due to recent changes to our platform layer.

__FIX__: ([#8567](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8567)) __Fixed rendering of untextured sprites in the editor__ 
Untextured sprites now show up in the editor viewport as long as their shader renders something.

__FIX__: ([#8569](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8569)) __Added support for sprite to not have a texture assigned__ 
This fixes an issue where the engine crashed if the sprite had no textures at all.
Now, the UV coordinates will encompass the entire sprite (since it has no atlas).

__FIX__: ([#8579](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8579)) __Check that texture width and height is valid before creating texture__ 
Calling `resource.create_texture()` with a width and/or height of zero crashed the engine. This change will check that the width and height are valid and throw a Lua error otherwise.

__FIX__: ([#8583](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8583)) __Use correct material tag for mesh components__ 
Fixed an issue where the wrong material tag was using when producing render lists.

__FIX__: ([#8591](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8591)) __Add `retry_count` and `retry_time` settings to the `game.project` file in the `html5` section.__ 
Two new settings are available in the `game.project` file in the `html5` section:
- `retry_count`: how many attempts the engine makes when trying to download a file.
- `retry_time`: pause in seconds before retrying file loading after an error.

>The default template `builtins/manifests/web/engine_template.html` has been changed. If you use your own custom template, make sure to update it with these changes.

__FIX__: ([#8547](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8547)) __Fix issues with `physics.set_shape()` when `Allow Dynamic Transforms`is on.__ 
Fix issues with `physics.set_shape()` which appears when `Allow Dynamic Transforms` option in `game.project` is on.

__FIX__: ([#8561](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8561)) __Fixed the way the HTML5 bundler splits and renames resource files__ 
Instead of using names like `game.arcd0` , `game.arcd1` , `game.arci0` for resource files in the HTML5 bundle, this fix keeps the file extension as is and adds filename counters instead: `game0.arcd` , `game1.arcd` , `game0.arci` . This will facilitate the use of custom server settings for files based on their filetype.

__FIX__: ([#8547](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8547)) __Add arm64-osx platform to manifests__ 
Add arm64-osx platform to release/headless manifests.
Fix js-web excludeLibs list.

## Editor
__NEW__: ([#8473](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8473)) __Add `editor.delete_directory()`__ 


__NEW__: ([#8510](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8510)) __Use async engine build in the editor__ 
The editor now uses async build server API. This should help with timeouts for long engine builds caused by big extensions.

__FIX__: ([#8522](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8522)) __Graph successor memory optimizations__ 
Large projects with a lot of connections will now use significantly less memory.

__FIX__: ([#8531](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8531)) __Hide texture formats and texture compressions from `*.textures_profiles` that are currently not supported.__ 
All the unsupported texture formats and texture compressions are hidden from `*.texture_profiles`.

__FIX__: ([#8563](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8563)) __Properly validate sprite texture assignments__ 
* Fixes a regression where you could build the project without properly assigning textures to all samplers in the assigned sprite material.
* Fixes an issue where the sprite animation dropdown would contain entries for the non-primary atlas if any sampler apart from the first one was assigned first.
* Mismatches between paged and unpaged materials and textures are now properly reported as build errors for sprites.

__FIX__: ([#8593](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8593)) __Paged atlas preview bugfix__
